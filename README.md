# Reproducibility Repository

This repository contains the required material to reproduce (most of) the results of the paper **Robust and Budget-Constrained Encoding Configurations for In-Memory Database Systems** (VLDB 2022).
It is not fully reproducible as we are not allowed to provide everything needed to replay the `DBMS` measurements.
