# Automated Encoding Selection
### Reproducibility Repository

This repository contains source code and artifacts for the paper **Robust and Budget-Constrained Encoding Configurations for In-Memory Database Systems** (VLDB 2022).

In case you have any questions, please contact [Martin Boissier](https://hpi.de/plattner/people/phd-students/martin-boissier.html).

## Setup

The repository contains the `encoding_plugin`. This is a Hyrise plugin that manages the communication with the Hyrise server. Hyrise itself is a third party module within the plugin.
