# Reproducibility Repository

This repository contains the required material to reproduce the results of the paper **Robust and Budget-Constrained Encoding Configurations for In-Memory Database Systems** (VLDB 2022).
The paper is not fully reproducible as we are not allowed to provide everything needed to replay the `DBMS X` measurements.

In case you have any questions, please contact [Martin Boissier](https://hpi.de/plattner/people/phd-students/martin-boissier.html).
